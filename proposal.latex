\title{Proposal: ICSF Documents on GitHub}
\author{Benedict Harcourt}

	\maketitle

	\begin{abstract}
  		Since their previous revision, both ICSF's Constitution and
		Standing Orders have been kept under revision control - meaning
		that all ``checked-in'' versions are always available.
		What we proposed is a mechanism for members to be able to
		suggest changes in a controlled manner at any time, backed on
		external purpose built software for handling distributed
		revision of documents.
